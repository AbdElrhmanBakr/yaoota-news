## Important

There is a [actions.yml] file inside directory [/.github/wworkflows] for auto deplyment to my server using ftp access for a direct live demo. Also there is a file [.htaccess] in public folder for handling the React Router Dom Routes as without it gives an error.

## PS

App post [Cards] on clicking on it header title will lead to its own post page with author, post, comments data and same for user name on post card will lead to its own user profile page with all of his posts and simple insight of the user.
